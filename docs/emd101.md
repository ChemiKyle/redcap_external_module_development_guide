# Building a REDCap Environment

These instructions describe how to set up a development environment that works on both Mac OSX, Windows, and Linux computers. While this version presents some issues for Windows computers, future versions should address that shortcoming through the use of `git-bash`.

## Setup Checklist for New Developers

This is a short list to get started, links to the required software are presented in the next section

1. Create a GitHub account
1. If using Windows, install git-bash
1. Install GitHub desktop
1. Configure GitHub desktop for your GitHub account
1. Install your editor
1. Configure GitHub desktop to use your editor, and git-bash
1. Install Docker Desktop
1. Download and unzip redcap-docker-compose
1. Set up your REDCap development instance

## Required Resources

These tools are recommended for those with no experience in software development, if you already know what you're doing, feel free to substitute your preferred tool where applicable (e.g. a different editor).
- A computer on which you have admin rights
- Windows users will need to install git bash - [https://gitforwindows.org/](https://gitforwindows.org/)
- A suitable web browser with developer tools [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) or [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).
    - [Firefox dev tools documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools)
    - [Chrome dev tools documentation](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools)
- GitHub account - [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)
- GitHub Desktop - [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/)
- Docker Desktop - [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- Text editor or PHP IDE - [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)/[VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) or [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/), may be best for beginners.
- redcap-docker-compose - A docker environment tailored for running and developing for REDCap. See [https://github.com/123andy/redcap-docker-compose](https://github.com/123andy/redcap-docker-compose)
- A REDCap `.zip` file - Ask your local REDCap Admin for a recent REDCap Zip file downloaded from the REDCap Community. The REDCap Zip files have names like `redcap10.3.3.zip` where '10.3.3' is the REDCap version number. If you _are_ that REDCap Admin and have access to the community, the download link is [https://community.projectredcap.org/page/download.html](https://community.projectredcap.org/page/download.html). Please be generous with access to the resources your employees and customers need to learn and develop for REDCap while reminding them of the need to not redistribute REDCap software outside the entity that has licensed it.


## REDCap-Specific Setup

- Open the `redcap-docker-compose` directory in VS Code

<img class="screenshot" alt="VSCodium open folder" src="/assets/img/vscodium_1.png"/>
<img class="screenshot" alt="VSCodium select redcap-docker-compose folder" src="/assets/img/vscodium_2.png"/>

- Open the file `.env` in the `rdc` directory

<img class="screenshot" alt="VSCodium select .env file" src="/assets/img/vscodium_3.png"/>

- Paste this block at the end of the file and save it.

```
TZ=America/Chicago
DOCKER_PREFIX=redcap
WEB_PORT=1935
MYSQL_PORT=2935
PHPMYADMIN_PORT=3935
MAILHOG_PORT=4935
```

- In GitHub Desktop open a terminal cd'd to the `redcap-docker-compose` folder with the keystroke \<ctrl\>```
- Change directories into the `rdc` folder with the command `cd rdc`
- In the terminal start the containers with this command `docker-compose up -d`

<img class="screenshot" alt="terminal nav and docker-compose up -d" src="/assets/img/terminal-dcup.png"/>

- Wait for the containers to build. This step will take some time.
- Once the containers are built, wait one more minute for the webpage to finish setting up.
- Access web-based redcap installer at [http://localhost:1935](http://localhost:1935) You should see this:

![REDCap Docker-Compose Installer](/assets/img/installer.png)

- Select 'Use a local copy of the full zip installer...'. Click Browse, locate redcap9.3.5.zip, and upload it.
- Select 'Prepopulate with table-based users and activate table authentication' and provide _your_ email address.
- Click 'INSTALL REDCAP'
- Wait a couple of minutes.
- When you see the green dialog boxes, the installation is complete.

![Successful installation](/assets/img/successful_installation.png)

- **Ignore the website instructions** to access the REDCap installer and access your fully functional local REDCap at [http://localhost:1935](http://localhost:1935)
- Login as admin. Your password is 'password'. Every user's account is 'password'.


## It didn't work!

Sometimes things are weird, and you'll have to rebuild from scratch. To do that, you'll need to open a terminal to the `redcap-docker-compose` folder and issue these commands:

```bash
# Preserve your modules folder because it might have stuff worth preserving
cp -r www/modules .

# The installer will get confused if any part of your old installation exists
rm -rf www
rm -rf logs

# You have to be in the right folder for docker-compose to find its config files
cd rdc

# Destroy the containers and their volumes
docker-compose down -v

# Rebuild the containers and volumes from scratch
docker-compose up -d
```

If it fails again, you'll need to dig deeper to find out why. It's probably just a small thing, but knowing which small thing is hard to anticipate. Sorry about that.

## After setup
Now that you have a working local instance of REDCap, you'll want to get familiar with the tools available to a REDCap administrator in [EMD-102: A Tour Through REDCap as an Admin](emd102) before moving on to the training exercises in [REDCap External Module Development for Developers](guide_for_devs).

## Add an extension to VS Code

VSCode can show you syntax errors as you type them if you add an extension. Add the _PHP Intellisense_ extension to VS Code to get this functionality.  On Mac access _Code > Preferences > Extensions_ and type "PHP". You'll see _PHP Intellisense_ in the list. Install it.

Open some PHP code, delete a semicolon or a comma and watch for the wiggly red lines under the text. Hover on one next to the text you just changed and consider what the editor is telling you.

## Footnotes

These instructions were adapted from a REDCap Development Class presented at the University of Arkansas Medical School in February 2020. The original document is located [here](development_class).

## Getting the development exercises

- Use GitHub Desktop to clone `ctsit/redcap_external_module_development_guide` (Go to File > Clone Repository, then paste `ctsit/redcap_external_module_development_guide` in the "github.com" tab).
- Use GitHub Desktop to open this new repo (REMDG) in Finder/Explorer. Copy everything in the `exercises/` folder to folder `redcap-docker-compose/www/modules/`. Don't copy the `exercises` folder; copy its _contents_.  These files should be inside the `redcap-docker-compose/www/modules/` folder
